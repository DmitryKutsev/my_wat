# ðŸ”® Jungâ€™s Word-Association Experiments â€“ Research & Analysis

## ðŸ“– Overview
This repository is dedicated to the exploration, analysis, and practical application of **Carl Gustav Jungâ€™s Word-Association Test (WAT)**, a pioneering psychological tool used to investigate the unconscious mind and emotional complexes. 

The project aims to:
- Implement the classical **Word-Association Test** methodology as a web app powered by LLMs.
- Analyze patterns in reaction times, associations, and emotional responses.
- Develop ML-based tools for identifying subconscious patterns and personal complexes.
- Provide open-source tools for further research.

## Background
**Jungâ€™s Word-Association Test** was a groundbreaking psychological experiment in which subjects were presented with stimulus words and asked to respond with the first word that came to mind. Jung observed delays, errors, or unusual responses as indicators of **emotional complexes** hidden in the unconscious.

Key elements in WAT analysis:
- **Reaction Time**: Delay in response hints at internal conflict.
- **Repeating Words**: Reflects persistent thought patterns.
- **Emotional Responses**: Indicate underlying psychological content.
